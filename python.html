		<h2>Python Unit 2</h2>
		<p>The purpose of this unit was to make a game where the person would jump</p>
		<p>over a wall and another object(depending on the person's choice)</p>
		<p>and if they touched any of them, then the game would be over.</p>
		<p>There was also a coin that would give them points for collecting</p>

		<h2>Python Unit 3</h2>
		<p>The purpose of this unit was to make a game where the person would run around</p>
		<p>a grass field and collect coins until the timer would run out. </p>
		<img src="images/pythonUnit3.png" width="500" height="500">
		<h2>Python Unit 4</h2>
		<p>The purpose of this unit was to make lists, and to make a game where you</p>
		<p>dodge enemies and try to get to the end of the map without getting hit.</p>

		<h2>Python Final Project</h2>
		<p>The purpose of this Project was to create a game that was different for</p>
		<p>each person. The purpose of my project was to run away from the enemies</p>
		<p>for as long as possible until you got hit. The game would end whenever </p>
		<p>you got hit.</p>
