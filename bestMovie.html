	<p> 	I really like this movie because it's hilarious, but has fighting at the same time.
		Its also really easy to watch, because it doesn't really get old
		You can watch this movie a million times and it will still make you laugh.

		I think that my favorite actor in this movie is chris tucker.
		The reason why is because he's a big shot, but he's really useless.
		He's also the funnier one out of the two in my opinion.
