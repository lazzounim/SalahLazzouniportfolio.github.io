		<h1>Scratch Content</h1>
		<h1>Name Assignment</h1>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Use scratch to design and create a program that shows my name.
		The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter in my name and give them 3 unique behaviors.
		The program needed to run when the green flag was clicked,
		and for extra credit I added a function to reset the scene to the beginning each time the green flag was clicked.

		<h2>Concepts Learned</h2>
		<p> Using event blocks - green flag clicked, when key was pressed. 
			Conditional statements - used if statements to……..
			Used loops - I used a forever block to….. I used a repeat until block to……...
			Sprites - I learned how to choose a sprite from the library for each letter of my name
			Movement - I used the x and y values to make my sprites move to their original location
			when the green flag was clicked, I rotated the sprites to…...

		<h1>Computer Buying Project</h1>
		<p>Used scratch to create a program for showing 4 different computer choices for one of our group’s family members.
		We chose 4 computers based off their needs,
		and created a powerpoint like program in scratch by clicking the right arrow button to move to the next backdrop.
		</p>
		<h2> Concepts learned </h2>
		<p> Switching backdrops - We learned how to switch backdrops to showcase different computer buying options.
			Conditional Statements - We used when ….. Is pressed to switch between different backdrops
			Sprites - We learned how to create sprites and use them as our computer models
