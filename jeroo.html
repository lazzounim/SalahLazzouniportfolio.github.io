		<h1>Jeroo Unit 1</h1>
		<h2>Nets</h2>
		<p>The goal of this lab was to take the flowers</p>
		<p>and toss them into the nets, to free the Jeroo</p>
		<img src="images/nets.png" height="500" width="500">
		<p> I learned the basics of Jeroo in this program</p>
		<h2>Diamond</h2>
		<p>The goal of this lab was to make a diamond of flowers</p>
		<p>on the island</p>
		<img src="images/diamond.png" height="500" width="500">
		<h1>Jeroo Unit 2</h1>
		<h2>Flowers</h2>
		<p>The goal of this lab was to make a box around the whole</p>
		<p>island</p>
		<img src="images/flowers.png" width="500" height="500">
		<p>In this project I learned how to plant  flowers in</p>
		<p>a big area</p>
		<h2>Watering Hole</h2>
		<p>The goal of this lab was to make a box around a body</p>
		<p>of water</p>
		<img src="images/wateringhole.png" width="500" height="500">
		<h1>Jeroo Unit 3</h1>
		<h2>Pinball</h2>
		<p>The goal of this lab was to clear all the flowers</p>
		<p>on the island</p>
		<img src="images/pinball.png" width="500" height="500">
		<p>In this lab I learned how to use loops to finish a task</p>
		<h2>Lockup</h2>
		<p>The goal of this lab was to help save the Jeroo trapped</p>
		<p>in the cage. You had to bring one Jeroo in to clear all</p>
		<p>the flowers in the map. Then you had to make it open a way</p>
		<p>for each jeroo to escape. Then writte a program for each</p>
		<p>Jeroo</p>
		<img src="images/lockup.png" width="500" height="500">
		<p>I learned how to make a method for each Jeroo individually</p>
		<p>and then to make them all escape with only 4 commands</p>
		<h1>Jeroo Unit 4</h1>
		<h2>Spiralmaze</h2>
		<p>The goal of spiral maze was to create a way for the Jeroo</p>
		<p>to find a way to get to the end of each maze. We were given</p>
		<p>3 mazes to complete.</p>
		<img src="images/spiral.png" width="500" height="500">
		<p> In this lab I learned how to make an if statement that would</p>
		<p>loop untill the Jeroo made it to the end of each maze.</p>
		<p>I also learned how to bring them back to the beginning.</p>
		<h2>Alley Run</h2>
		<p>The goal of this lab was to pick a flower if it was next</p>
		<p> to you. To disable all of the nets. Last, to make all of</p>
		<p>the water blocks have a flower opposite to them</p>
		<img src="images/alleyrun.png" width="500" height="500">
		<p>In this lab I learned to make a loop to tell the Jeroo</p>
		<p>to pick all flowers,get rid of all nets,and to put flowers</p>
		<p>across from each water block.</p>
